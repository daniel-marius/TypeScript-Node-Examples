# Building Strongly-Typed REST Clients With Typescript

Typescript type definitions for a client to work with an imaginary Book Catalog REST API.

Some of the features these type definitions enable are:

- strongly-typed resource paths
- resource path template detection and making path parameters required.
- strongly-typed responses
- strongly-typed request payload that help users build the request without the need to go back and forth to the REST documentation.
